## Technical Skills
The skills you should have them to develop yourself in the technical area you are in.

### Self Development
Software development is a marathon never ends. When you find out how to learn yourself, you will not get tired in the marathon.

- Make meaningful Google searches such as `ios swift how to handle button click`, `ios swiftui binding vs state`. Google is the best way to get answers about the issue you are facing with. The great search brings the best solution
- Always have a side project besides your work at the office. You are free to integrate new features into your project because you are the boss!
- Internet has a lot of qualified articles, benefit them! Make 15 mins reading time every day just before starting the work
- Build open-source projects even if they are small ones. Publish them to everyone in the package management systems. [Example side project ideas for iOS development](https://github.com/demirciy/ExampleProjectIdeas)

## Soft Skills
They are the skills you need out of the technical area. They are essential as much as technical skills.
  
### Self Confidence
It is needed to show/promote yourself. You should balance it, not too much, not too less.  

There are some tricks to gain some self confidence,
- Put real, professional, friendly, cool profile pictures on social profiles such as Linkedin, Twitter, GitHub, Medium, etc.
- Make social profiles public
- Share your knowledge on social profiles
- Be aware of your skills
- Do not call yourself Junior everytime

### Email Usage
When you want to start a conversation that is essential/serious, email comes to help.

Here are some tips/information about how the email works,
- The receiver can see CC, not BCC
- Put your manager to CC in case the email contains essential information/decision
- Ask the recruiter to send you the job contract via email. It shows you are professional and you will get the offer in a serious way.
- Fill the email message like you write an essay
- Start the email with `Hello`, `Hi XXX`, end it with `Best Regards`, `Have a Good Day`
- Tell the situation as clear as you can

### Resume
Your resume is your first impression that must be great to make the further steps easier for you.

There are some common thoughts most of the developers agree with,
- Find a cool template. It does not have to be colorful, just cool. Hire a designer to build one for you
- Make it consistent, font, colors, alignment
- It's highly recommended that it should not over a single page. No HR person is looking forward to reading your all resume carefully. Make their work easier
- Order sections by importance. Generally, the order from top to bottom is, personal information(e-mail, place), about(telling yourself), experience, projects, skills, certificates, education. Some of the sections might be more powerful than others, move them to upper
- No one needs your private personal information, such as long address, gsm, married or not. You don't have to put them in your resume
- Adapt your picture by the continent. The companies are in United States don't prefer pictures in your resume. They only care about your skills, not look. Other countries are not strict as in United States
- Put a picture that shows your professionality, sincerity. Don't be look like too formal or informal, just normal. Of course, smile :)
- Do not score your skills. It make looks you amateur. You might have limited knowledge in the area you score yourself. How can you score yourself then? Let others score you
- Use specific keywords are related to your technology domain. Use them in the projects, experience sections. HR looks for them
- Do not pass the about section without telling yourself in. HR is the first person he/she will have a look at your resume. You are supposed to impress him/her first. Tell your soft skills, hobbies in the about section.
- Write the resume in English

### Time Management
Time is the asset that you can not buy with anything(even bitcoin).

Punctuality is the value on the people you meet, hang out with. If you arrive the meeting cafe or attend the video conference on time, you become trustworthy which is the key to being surrounded by qualified people.

Some tricks to manage your time smartly,
- Use calendar for every kind of event, meetings with friends, hiking, deadlines(credit card/loan last payment date), etc. You can not attend two meetings at the same time :) Plan your day before
- Use reminders to not miss anything important. `send the document to xxx`, `call xxx`, `take xxx`
- Prioritize the jobs. Difficult ones first because you will have enough patience and motivation at the start
- Use the kanban board in Trello to manage your projects(especially the freelance ones). [Guide for the kanban board in Trello](https://getnave.com/blog/trello-kanban-boards/)
